GSnakey v0.7

GTK Snake game based on Google Old Snakey!

If you enjoy playing Old Snakey! on GMail you will probably enjoy GSnakey. It's
very similar but with much more maps. Maps are also very easy to create.

Requires GTK+2.0 and Cairo. 

Usage:
        make
        ./GSnakey
        
Controls:
        Up    : Up Arrow
        Down  : Down Arrow
        Right : Right Arrow
        Left  : Left Arrow
        Pause : Space
        Reset : Esc
        
This version is not final and may have several bugs. Also the code actually sucks
and should not be considered as an example.
